  "shm-feature-1-title": "EVM based layer 1 network",
  "shm-feature-1-desc": "Since you just need to deploy a smart contract written in developer-friendly languages like Solidity & Vyper on Shardeum, it is tailor-made for both new & existing developers to build dApps within minutes.",
  "shm-feature-2-title": "Linear scalability & low gas forever",
  "shm-feature-2-desc": "Every node that joins the Shardeum network immediately increases the transactions per second (TPS) and total capacity of the network to achieve linear scaling and ensure low transaction fees even as the usage grows.",
  "shm-feature-3-title": "Dynamic Sharding & Atomic Composibility",
  "shm-feature-3-desc": "Nodes on Shardeum are assigned dynamic address ranges across multiple shards. Since the consensus takes place at the transaction level, the network will retain parallel and atomic processing of transactions resulting in immediate finality/very low latency.",
  "shm-feature-4-title": "Anyone can operate a node",
  "shm-feature-4-desc": "Hardware requirements to operate a validator node are kept low by offloading historical data to archive nodes and adding more nodes to reduce the load on each validator.",
  "shm-feature-5-title": "Autoscaling & High fairness",
  "shm-feature-5-desc": "Shardeum will autoscale based on demand in the network keeping its operational cost low while maintaining low gas fees. The network will further process transactions on FCFS basis to ensure fairness eliminating miner extractable value (MEV).",
  "shm-feature-6-title": "Solid security",
  "shm-feature-6-desc": "A leaderless <a style='color:#ec5c28' href='https://shardeum.org/blog/consensus-mechanism-used-in-shardeum/' target='_blank' >Proof-of-Quorum</a> (PoQ) consensus algorithm, Proof-of-Stake (PoS) with slashing, standby nodes, node rotation and permissionless participation - all contributes to boost the security of the network.",
